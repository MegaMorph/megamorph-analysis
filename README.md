megamorph-analysis
==================

A public home for various scripts related to the analysis of data in
the [MegaMorph](http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/astronomy/megamorph) project.

Some of these scripts may be useful for others using the codes
developed by [MegaMorph](https://github.com/MegaMorph): GALFITM and [GALAPAGOS](http://github.com/MegaMorph/galapagos).

Note that the MegaMorph GAMA and nearby-galaxies catalogues used in
these scripts are not yet public.
